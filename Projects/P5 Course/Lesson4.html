    <h1>Lesson 4: Creative Coding</h1>

      <p>In this lesson you will learn to work with color, create some funny shapes and set some conditions.</p>
      <p>click on these topics..</p>
      <div id="divFillCode">
        <label>Fill in your code:</label><input id="inCode" type="text"></input><input type="button" onclick="setCode()" value="Set"></input>
        <div id="divMsg" class="info" style="color:red;">Sorry, wrong code!</div><br/>
        <p>If you don't know your code, you got after the lesson 3, send me an email. I will send you a new one.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="divLesson" class="info">
      <h2 onclick="show(divWhat);"><img src="resources/bol.png" alt="bol" width="20"/> What can you learn?</h2>
        <div id="divWhat" class="info" onclick="show(this);" >
          <p>In the last lesson we created a little racing game. The cars drove from left to right. If you were fast you could bet which car should win.<br/>
           I bet it was a close-finish!</p>
           <p>In this lesson you can learn to improve this game with conditions and colors.</p>
           <h3 onclick="show(divCondition);"><img src="resources/bol.png" alt="bol" width="15"/> Conditions and expressions</h3>
           <div id="divCondition" class="info" onclick="show(this);" >
             <p>In a language you use a condition when you use words as if and but, when, then, after, before, under, above, etc.
               In code we can use <strong>if</strong><br/>
               If is a powerfull function in javascript. You get control over the execution of your code.</p>

               <pre>
                 if(<i>expression</i>){
                     //do this
                 }
                 else{
                    //do this
                 }
               </pre>
             <p>Now you get control over your car so you can improve this game.<br/>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;-start when you click on your mouse.<br/>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;-stop after you reached the finish line.<br/>
               Between the parenthesis there is an expression, that is <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>.<br/>
               This expression can be:<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;  - a variable that stores the value true or valse.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;  - a logical expression like: <br/>
                <pre>
                a == b (a is equal to b)
                a > b ( a is greater then b)
                a < b ( a is smaller then b)
                a >= b ( a is greater then or equal to b)
                 a <= b ( a is smaller then or equal to b)
                (a and b are variable, the sine between a and b are operators.
                the result of an expression is always true or false.)
              </pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;  - a combination with logical expressions
              <pre>
                a > b && c == d  (a is greater then b AND c is equal to d. this is true if both expressions are true.)
                a > b || c == d  (a is greater then b OR  c is equal to d. this is true if one of the expressions is true.)

              </pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;  - a function (a function can return with a value, but I will discus this later in the course.)
              </p>
              <p>
              So this is a lot to comprehend. Let's have a look at some examples.
              Also on the Example page you can find several examples.
            </p>

          </p>
            <pre>
              if(mouseIsPressed){
                  // start your engines!
              }
            </pre>
            or if you use a keyboard.
            <pre>
              if(keyIsPressed){
                  // start your engines!
              }
            </pre>
            <p>
            As you can see the else{..} part of this function is not always neccessary.
            Here is an example with if and else:<br/>
            Imagen a tree is growing:</p>
            <pre>
            if(size == 100){            // == <i> is equal to </i>
              //we chop the tree
              size = 0;
            }
            else{
              //the tree is growing
              size += 1;
            }
          </pre>
            <p> x = 2 means the variable x , a little box with the name x, has the value 2 inside him now. this is an assignment not an expression.<br/>
             x == 2 means, if the variable x has the value 2, then this is <strong>true</strong> if not this expression is <strong>false</strong>.
             You never can use an assignment after if. This is a mistake every programmer will make, because the difference is so small.</p>

         There is an example page where you can find examples, created with only functions you have learned so far.

         Feel free to copy some of the functions to your own p5 editor and try to change them.
         It is good practice to copy code and learn by trying.
