    Nijemirdum in Friesland is not the center of the world, but here is my studio and through the internet I discovered the world of creative coding.<br/><br/>

    For me creative coding brings two worlds together; ICT and Art.  I worked 14 years at a software company and after that period  I went a year to art-school in Groningen.<br/>
    I started with creative coding in javascript. <br/>
    Then I discovered Processing and P5 and I was lost. I enjoy making art with code and everytime I surprise myself with the results. <br/>
    I hope you will enjoy it too on this site.
<br/><br/>
    I think the computer is a great tool for creating art or creative things, what ever...
