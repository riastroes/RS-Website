    <h1>Knitting</h1>
    <br/><br/><br/>
    <p>Knitting is a fashinating technique of one thread following a path.
    </p>
    <h3>Technical Proces</h3>
    <p>
      The patterns are coded and after that saved as jpg or svg and imported in
      Inkscape, Inkscape is the opensource variant of Illustrator. The next step is
      to export a .dxf file and import this in 123D Design, a 3D modulator program that
      is abel to export .stl files. This file format can be import in CURA, the
      software of the 3D printer, that generates .gcode for this 3D printer, the Ultimaker+.
    </p>
    <h3>Experiments</h3>
    <img src="resources/experimenten.jpg" align="center"/>
    <p>In this project I am experimenting with 3D printers, my goal is to
      print some knittings very thin. For now the printer is too sloppy, when I
      print too thin. The construction is not solid enough, there are holes in
      the lines. This is because the software is constructing the form based
      on the borders of the thread of the knitting. So it is surrounding every hole with
      a loop and is not following the beautiful path of the thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step will be to generate the .gcode streight from within the code and
      skip all the processteps in between.
