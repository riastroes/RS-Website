    <h1>Creative Coding</h1>
    <p>
    wiki:
    Creative coding is a type of computer programming in which the goal is
    to create something expressive instead of something functional.
    It is used to create live visuals and for VJing,
    as well as creating visual art and design, art installations, projections and projection mapping,
    sound art, advertising, product prototypes, and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
    As you can see on my site, there are a lot of possibilities with creative coding.
    I use javascript as my art material and at the moment I like to experiment with techniques,
    how I can use my code in the "real world", for example on fabrics and in combination with other techniques like 3D printers, Lasercutters, Plotters etc.
